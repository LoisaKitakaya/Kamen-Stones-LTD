# kamen-stones-ltd

## Where the project is so far

The website design is complete. However some parts (in terms of functionality have not yet been implemented: e.g. the subscription and contact forms). Also the products page is not fully responsive in mobile view.

As it stands the website subject to criticism by the client and any changes decided upon shall then be implemented.

## Matters of the URL

### Current Domain Name (URL)

https://loisakitakaya.github.io/Kamen-Stones-LTD/

### About future Domain Name (URL)

In future we would require a custom domain name (URL). If that be the case; we could buy a custom domain name from [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com).

An example of a suitable domain name would be something like:

- www.kamenstones.com
- www.kamenstonesltd.com
